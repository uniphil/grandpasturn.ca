    "description": "An early take on bowl design using stable lumber that has less possibility of changing shape while drying. These blocks call for a steady hand and sharp chisel as sanding kiln dried material calls for a more robust abrasive taking longer. Kiln-dried material will also “fly apart” more than green wood turning. Besides design and shape the grain of this piece is quite spectacular. An angle cut was taken from the block to place opposing grains across the bowl from each other. Bowl 3 is experimental."

By adding the little “flip” to the outside rim I was able to hollow out a very comfortable “feel” to the wood. Has “tactile” beauty more than many likely due to the projecting rim."
